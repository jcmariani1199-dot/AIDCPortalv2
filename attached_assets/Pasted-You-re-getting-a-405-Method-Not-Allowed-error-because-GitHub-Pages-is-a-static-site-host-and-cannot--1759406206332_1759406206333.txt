You're getting a 405 Method Not Allowed error because GitHub Pages is a static site host and cannot process API requests. It can only serve pre-built files like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; it doesn't have a backend server to handle dynamic operations like a POST request for a login.

Why This Happens: Static vs. Dynamic Sites
Think of your GitHub Pages site as a finished brochure. You can hand it out (a GET request), and people can look at it, but they can't submit a form or log into it because it's just paper. It has no engine or brain to process information.

Static Sites (GitHub Pages): Serve pre-built files exactly as they are. They can only handle GET requests to fetch these files.

Dynamic Sites: Have a backend (server-side code) that can process incoming data, interact with a database, and run logic. This is what's needed to handle a POST request for an authentication endpoint like /api/auth/login.

When you send a POST request to GitHub Pages, its server responds with 405 Method Not Allowed because it's fundamentally not built to accept anything other than a GET request for a file.

How to Fix It: Moving Your Backend Logic
To make your login functionality work, you need to host your backend API code on a service that can run it. Your frontend on GitHub Pages will then send the API request to that service instead of a relative path on the same site.

Here are your main options:

Use a Serverless Function Provider: This is a modern and often cost-effective approach. You can deploy just your API endpoints to a service that runs them on demand.

Examples: Vercel, Netlify, AWS Lambda, or Google Cloud Functions.

How it works: You would move your API logic (the code that handles the login) to one of these platforms. They will give you a new URL for your API. In your frontend code on GitHub Pages, you would change the request URL from /api/auth/login to the full URL provided by Vercel, Netlify, etc.

Use a Dedicated Backend Hosting Service: You can deploy your entire backend application to a platform designed for it.

Examples: Render, Heroku, or a cloud virtual machine.

How it works: Similar to serverless functions, you'll get a URL for your backend. You'll update your frontend to point to this new URL. This is a good option if you have a more complex, traditional backend framework.

Use a Third-Party Authentication Service (BaaS): For login specifically, this is often the easiest path. These services handle all the backend complexity of user management for you.

Examples: Firebase Authentication, Supabase, or Auth0.

How it works: You sign up for the service, configure your authentication settings, and then use their provided client-side library (SDK) in your frontend code to manage login, signup, and user sessions. You won't need to write or host your own /api/auth/login endpoint at all.
